# SI-330-Final-Project
My project looks at shot data and betting data for the NHL in the 2017-2018 season. I chose this project because I am an avid hockey fan and thought it would be interesting to explore how different shot metrics would correlate with betting data to find if there were any paticular shooting metrics that were found more often in teams that were favored or underdogs.
